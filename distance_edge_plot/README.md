## Motion x delta-Edge (pre-scrub - post-scrub)

* Produce plots that diagnose whether distance between nodes is correlated with the correlation network's edge strength
	+ See Power et al. (2014) Figure 8
	 
* Requires: 
	+ Data matrix (node x node x subjects) pre-scrubbing
	+ Data matrix post-scrubbing
	+ Distance matrix (e.g., euclidean distance between nodes)
